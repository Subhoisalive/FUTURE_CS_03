# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System — Cyber Security Task 3

> Developed as part of the **Cyber Security Internship** at **Future Interns**.

This project demonstrates a secure file sharing system using **AES encryption** for safe file uploads and downloads. It simulates a real-world solution for scenarios like secure document exchange in **healthcare**, **legal**, or **corporate environments**.


## 📌 About the Task

In this hands-on internship project, I built a **simple yet secure file sharing system** with the following features:

- Upload and download files through a Flask-based web portal
- Apply **AES encryption** to all files before saving
- Decrypt files securely on download
- Basic **key management**
- Document the system architecture, code, and encryption strategy

## ✅ What I Did

- 🔧 Built a full-stack application using **Python Flask**
- 🔐 Used **AES (128-bit ECB)** encryption via **PyCryptodome**
- 📤 Implemented file upload, encryption, and secure storage
- 📥 Built download flow with automatic decryption
- 🌐 Designed a simple HTML frontend with basic forms
- 🧪 Tested for integrity and functionality
- 📄 Documented the encryption logic and code structure


## 🎯 Skills Gained

- Backend web development with Flask
- Implementing AES encryption in Python
- Secure file handling & data protection techniques
- Basic cryptographic key management
- Version control with Git & GitHub
- Hands-on Flask + Cryptography integration
